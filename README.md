# Customer Behaviour Analysis - Shopping-Insights

## Project Overview
This project delves into understanding customer behavior through analysis of their purchase history, demographics, and preferences. It leverages SQL for data retrieval and cleaning, and Python's powerful libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### Technologies Used:
#### SQL: Data Retrieval and Preparation
#### Python:
NumPy: Numerical computations, 
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis, 
Seaborn: Statistical data visualization, 
Matplotlib: General-purpose data visualization

#### Data Source
CSV file: (In the datasets)
Columns:
Customer_ID, Age, Gender, Item_Purchased, Category, Purchase_Amount, US_States, Size, Color, Season, ReviewRating, Subscription_Status, Shipping_Type, Discount_Applied, Promo_Code_Used, Previous_Purchases_Quantity, Payment_Method, Frequency_of_Purchases

### Key Analysis Areas
Customer Segmentation: Identify distinct customers based on demographics, purchase patterns, and preferences.
Purchase Patterns: Analyze purchase frequency, average spending, popular items, and seasonal trends.
Product Preferences: Explore top-selling items and category preferences
Marketing Effectiveness: Evaluate the impact of promotions, discounts, and subscription programs on customer behavior.
Customer Retention: Identify factors that influence customer loyalty and retention rates.
