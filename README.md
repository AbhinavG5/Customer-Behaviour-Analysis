It leverages SQL for data retrieval and cleaning, and Python's powerful libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### Technologies Used:
#### SQL: Data Retrieval and Preparation
#### Python:
NumPy: Numerical computations, 
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis, 
Seaborn: Statistical data visualization, 
Matplotlib: General-purpose data visualization

#### Data Source
CSV file: (In the datasets)
Columns:
Customer_ID, Age, Gender, Item_Purchased, Category, Purchase_Amount, US_States, Size, Color, Season, ReviewRating, Subscription_Status, Shipping_Type, Discount_Applied, Promo_Code_Used, Previous_Purchases_Quantity, Payment_Method, Frequency_of_Purchases
